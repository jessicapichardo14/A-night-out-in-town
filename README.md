# Capital One - Summit Challenge 2020: A Night Out in Town

Link:  https://a-night-out-in-town.herokuapp.com/

**NOTE**

**All criteria were satisfied for this project, including the last requirement which allowed me to obtain the user location via HTML5 Geolocation.**

An interactive search engine based on the events happening in your area, utilizing the Yelp API. 

## Summary:

Prior to starting this web app, I have no knowledge of full-stack web development, web frameworks like Flask, API calls. Basically saying I have never done anything like this. My only experience has been doing some Python, CSS3, HTML5 and Java class projects.

* What I've learned from this project: *

1. How to access an API using POSTMAN and Python calls
2. How to create a frontend using HTML5, CSS3, and JS and connect it to backend operations using Python Flask and Jinja templating 
3. Jquery ajax functions to retrieve API data
4. Learned about JSON document response
5. Learned how Geolocation works with in a cite
6. Loop through a list in HTML
7. Learned what JSON data to retrieve key/value pairs were needed in order to serve data to the front-end

This was one the of most amazing learning experiences I've had because I walked into this only knowing the basics of Python, Java, HTML5, and CSS3. This forced me to do some research on how to build a website by reading through documentation, source debugging using help from Stackoverflow and many other online sources. As well as asking for help whenever I got stuck trying to figure something out.

I became familiar with the manipulation of data and empty values when learning how to create a card in Bootstrap using a Jinja for-loop to create the cards while having the JSON data come in from Python.

My favorite part of doing this project was learning how to use Javascript to create the Geolocator which also came from the JSON data that came in from Python while using the attributes that I saw in POSTMAN. As well as creating a function search box. Also,  desgining the front of the application because it allowed me to see what worked and did not work in the front end. Which allowed me to visually see how every single line of code did and how the two connected. 

## Challenge:

Using unfamiliar technologies. I had to become familiar with many different concepts, languages, and frameworks in what can be said a short amount of time. While also trying to develop a well functioning front and back-end web application.

## Tech/Frameworks Used: 
Bootstrap,
HTML5, CSS, Jquery/Javascript,
POSTMAN,
Python,
Flask w/ Jinja Templating

## Future Updates:
- Learn how to convert Flask app to VueJS for more functionality 
-Create:
  - Storage saver, where your previous searches can pop up to save you     time
  - More features like ratings and how expensive it may be
 - Better Geomap markers
 
## Conclusion: 
This experience has taught me that I am capable of building a website without having the knowledge of how to build one from scratch. This gave me a boost of confidence, excitement, and pleasure of the work Capital One has pushed me to do. Especially because this is not the type of project that your typical university introduces to students.

I am truly looking forward to continuing my self-learning as well as becoming a better developer as well to continue building on this project and many more to come. Thank for giving me and many other students this opportunity, Capital one.
